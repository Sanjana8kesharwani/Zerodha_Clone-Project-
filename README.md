# Zerodha_Clone

This project is a Zerodha Clone, a simulation of a stock trading platform that provides users with a realistic trading experience. However, please note that this project is for learning purposes only, and users cannot actually invest or trade real stocks. It is built using React.js and follows a modular structure, separating the backend, dashboard, and frontend for better scalability and maintainability.
